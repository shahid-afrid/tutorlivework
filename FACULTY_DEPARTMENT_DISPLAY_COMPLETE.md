## ?? Security & Data Flow

1. **Profile Page**: Reads from `Faculty` model
2. **Edit Profile GET**: Maps Department from Faculty to ViewModel
3. **Edit Profile POST**: 
   - Department stored in hidden input
   - Preserved during profile updates
   - Cannot be modified by user
4. **Controller**: Department remains unchanged in update logic

---

## ?? Styling

### Department Badge (Edit Profile):
```css
.department-badge {
    display: inline-block;
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--faculty-purple), var(--warm-gold));
    color: white;
    padding: 8px 20px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    font-weight: 600;
    font-size: 1em;
    letter-spacing: 0.5px;
    margin-top: 5px;
}
```
